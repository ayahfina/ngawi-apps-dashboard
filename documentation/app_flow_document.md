# Ngawi-Apps-Dashboard App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user arrives, they open the web application by navigating to its public landing page or using a direct link. On this page, they will see options to sign up or sign in. To create an account, the user clicks on the Sign Up link, fills out their email address and a secure password, and submits the form. After a confirmation email is sent, the user verifies their address and is automatically redirected to the sign-in page. Here, they provide their credentials to gain access. If the user ever forgets their password, they can click the “Forgot Password” link on the sign-in page, enter their email, and receive a reset link. Clicking that link brings them to a secure reset screen where they choose a new password. At any point after signing in, the user can sign out by clicking their avatar in the header and selecting the Sign Out option.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once signed in, the user lands on the main dashboard at the `/dashboard` route. The page opens with a header bar showing the application title, a dark mode toggle switch, and the user’s avatar with a dropdown for account actions. Along the left side, a vertical navigation menu lists links to Dashboard, Aplikasi, Perangkat Daerah, Vendor, and other management sections. In the main content area, the user sees summary cards that display the total number of registered applications, counts of active versus inactive applications, and the number of agencies with associated entries. All data in these summary cards is loaded by a Server Component using Drizzle ORM queries so the page loads quickly on initial render, while interactive controls such as filters and pagination are handled by Client Components.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user selects the Aplikasi link, they are taken to `/dashboard/aplikasi`, where they see a data table listing every application record. This list is built with `shadcn/ui` table components and may include filtering controls at the top. To add a new application, the user clicks the Add New button. They are routed to `/dashboard/aplikasi/new`, where a form collects fields like application name, perangkat daerah, vendor, programming languages, and frameworks. For each related field, the form uses a custom Combobox with Create component. If the desired perangkat daerah is not in the dropdown, the user clicks the “Add New” icon next to it, opening a modal dialog on top of the same page. Inside that dialog, the user enters the new agency name, submits, and sees the modal close while the new option appears in the combobox. After filling all fields, the user clicks Submit. A server action runs on the backend using Drizzle ORM to save the new aplikasi record. On success, the user is redirected back to the aplikasi list with a confirmation message.

To edit an existing application, the user clicks the Edit icon in a table row. This loads `/dashboard/aplikasi/[id]/edit`, prepopulating the form with the current data. The same Combobox with Create components ensure consistency when updating related entities. Once the user updates any fields and clicks Save, a server action runs to update the database, and the user returns to the list view with updated table data. Deleting an application is done by clicking a Trash icon next to a row, which triggers a confirmation dialog. When confirmed, the application is removed via an API route, and the table refreshes instantly.

Perangkat Daerah management uses an identical pattern under `/dashboard/perangkat-daerah` for listing, adding, editing, and deleting agencies. Vendors, programming languages, and frameworks each have their own routes following this same CRUD flow, ensuring every entity in the database can be managed without leaving the dashboard area. Behind the scenes, corresponding API routes under `/app/api` expose GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE operations with standardized JSON responses.

## Settings and Account Management

The user can manage their personal profile by clicking the avatar in the header and choosing Account Settings. On this page, they can update their display name, change their email, and set a new password. Notification preferences, such as whether to receive email alerts when new applications are added, are toggled here. Once changes are saved, a server action updates the user record and shows a success notification. From settings, the user can return to the main dashboard by clicking the Dashboard link in the navigation menu or the application logo in the header.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the user enters invalid or incomplete data in any form field, inline validation messages appear next to the offending field, prompting correction before submission. If the network connection drops during an API call, a toast notification informs the user of the error and suggests retrying. Attempting to navigate to a protected page without a valid session automatically redirects the user to the sign-in screen. If the user tries to access a non-existent route, a friendly 404 page greets them, offering links back to the dashboard or sign-in page. In every error scenario, clear messages guide the user on how to fix the problem and resume normal workflow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a user signs up or signs in, they are guided into a secure, responsive dashboard experience. The main dashboard provides instant insights into application counts and status breakdowns. From there, managing entities like aplikasi, perangkat daerah, vendors, and technical stacks follows a consistent pattern of list views, in-place form modals, and straightforward navigation. Account settings and password recovery flows ensure users maintain control over their credentials. Clear error handling and redirects keep users on track. In daily usage, a government employee can log in, review key statistics, add or edit records, and sign out with minimal effort, all while benefiting from type-safe database interactions and a modern user interface.
